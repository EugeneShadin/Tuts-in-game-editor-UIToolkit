### [Part 2: Context Menu](Readme.md)
Implement a dynamic right-click menu that supports icons and submenus.

### Try implementing the following improvements:
* Enhance the icon selector so that it responds to the button’s state (e.g., changing colour or becoming semi-transparent on hover or press).
* Add support for an arrow icon on the right side of the button to indicate the presence of a submenu visually. The arrow should also react to button states.
* ⭐ Bonus challenge: Implement multi-level submenus. Buttons with submenus should display the arrow icon, and when clicked, open the submenu next to the parent item. Make sure the submenu doesn’t extend beyond the screen boundaries.
